Decimal to Binary

Given a non-negative integer, return its binary representation as a string.

A binary number uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent any number. To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. Repeat until the number is zero. Read the remainders last recorded to first. For example, to convert 12 to binary:

12 รท 2 = 6 remainder 0
6 รท 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 รท 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 รท 2 = 0 remainder 1

12 in binary is 1100.
